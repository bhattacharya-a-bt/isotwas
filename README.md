# isotwas

Welcome to `isotwas`, a package that facilitates isoform-level transcriptome wide associations studies. This package contains models to train multivariate predictive models of isoform-level expression and run isoform-level trait mapping to identify genetic associations with complex traits.

To install: `devtools::install_github("bhattacharya-a-bt/isoTWAS")`

Pre-computed isoTWAS models for 48 GTEx tissues and adult and fetal
frontal cortext (PsychENCODE; Gandal et al 2018, Science and
Walker et al 2019, Cell) are provided at https://zenodo.org/record/6795947. 
Please cite the manuscript
(forthcoming) and the Zenodo link when using these models in your work.
