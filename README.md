# isotwas

Welcome to `isotwas`, a package that facilitates isoform-level transcriptome wide associations studies. This package contains models to train multivariate predictive models of isoform-level expression and run isoform-level trait mapping to identify genetic associations with complex traits.

To install: `devtools::install_github("bhattacharya-a-bt/isotwas")`

Pre-computed isoTWAS models for 48 GTEx tissues and adult and developmental 
cortex (PsychENCODE; Gandal et al 2018, Science and
Walker et al 2019, Cell) are provided on Zenodo at the following
links: GTEx (https://zenodo.org/records/10974575), adult cortex (https://zenodo.org/records/10642062),
and developmental cortex (https://zenodo.org/records/10642128). 
Please cite [the manuscript](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-023-01560-2) and the Zenodo link when using these models in your work.
