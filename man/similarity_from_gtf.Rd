\title{Create Isoform Similarity Matrix from GTF}
\usage{
similarity_from_gtf(
  gtf_path,
  gene,
  method = c("jaccard", "overlap_coef", "binary"),
  transcript_ids = NULL,
  min_transcripts = 2,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{gtf_path}{character, path to GTF file (can be gzipped)}

\item{gene}{character, gene name (HGNC symbol) or Ensembl gene ID}

\item{method}{character, similarity method:
\itemize{
  \item "jaccard": Jaccard index based on exon overlap (default)
  \item "overlap_coef": Overlap coefficient = overlap / min(length_i, length_j)
  \item "binary": 1 if any overlap, 0 otherwise
}}

\item{transcript_ids}{character vector, optional subset of transcript IDs to include.
If NULL, uses all transcripts for the gene.}

\item{min_transcripts}{int, minimum number of transcripts required (default 2)}

\item{verbose}{logical, print progress messages}
}
\value{
A list containing:
  \itemize{
    \item similarity_matrix: symmetric matrix of pairwise isoform similarities
    \item transcript_ids: character vector of transcript IDs (matrix row/col names)
    \item gene_id: matched gene identifier
    \item n_transcripts: number of transcripts
    \item n_exons: named vector of exon counts per transcript
  }
}
\description{
Parses a GTF file and creates a similarity matrix for isoforms of a specified
gene based on shared exon structure. This matrix can be used with
\code{\link{multivariate_graph_reg}} for graph-regularized prediction.
}
\details{
The function computes pairwise similarity between isoforms based on their
exon structure. Isoforms that share more exonic sequence are considered
more similar, reflecting the biological intuition that they likely share
more cis-regulatory effects.

The Jaccard similarity is computed as:
\deqn{J(i,j) = \frac{|overlap(exons_i, exons_j)|}{|union(exons_i, exons_j)|}}

where overlap and union are computed in terms of genomic base pairs.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Create similarity matrix for BRCA1 isoforms
sim <- similarity_from_gtf("gencode.v45.annotation.gtf.gz", "BRCA1")

# Use with graph-regularized prediction
model <- multivariate_graph_reg(X, Y, similarity_matrix = sim$similarity_matrix)
}
